This repo is used to teach how to use git and github for the beginners.

#### [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git):
> "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency"

#### [GitHub](https://github.com/):
> "GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features."

#### What is README?
Many projects contain a file named "README" that gives a general description of what the project does and how to use it. It's often a good idea to read this file before doing anything with the project, so the file is given this name to make users more likely to read it.

#### List of Important Commands:
> diff
